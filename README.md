# Football Player Acquisition & Team Management Optimization

## Introduction
In the competitive arena of professional football, strategic player acquisition and management are crucial for a team's success. This project harnesses Gurobi optimization techniques to offer teams a sophisticated, data-driven framework for making informed decisions on player acquisitions, lineups, and coaches. Focusing on multiple objective optimization with a hierarchical approach and discrete optimization through Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP), the project aims to assess player selections and critically evaluate coaching decisions.


## Features
- **Player Selection and Transfers**: Optimal squad and lineup strategies for Manchester City and Manchester United (2016-2017 season).
- **Coaching Strategies**: Analyzing coaching decisions to maximize team performance, with a case study on the German national team.
- **Optimization Model**: Detailed mathematical formulations including constraints for player selection and team composition.
- **Results**: Empirical analysis comparing optimized selections with actual team performances.
